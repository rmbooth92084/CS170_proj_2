## Description
 This was the final project I did for my Intro to AI class. What I implemented was 2 multiple linear regressions which were forward elimination and backwards elemination and tested it with a veriety different amount of features and their entecities to figure which are more accurate in finding the right cobinations to catorizes objects.
